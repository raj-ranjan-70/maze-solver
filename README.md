🧭 Maze Runner – Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

This project is an interactive Maze Runner visualizer built to demonstrate how different pathfinding algorithms explore and solve grid-based mazes. It provides a clear, side-by-side understanding of how each algorithm behaves, making it a powerful tool for learning, teaching, or showcasing algorithmic concepts.

🚀 Features

Four pathfinding algorithms implemented:

BFS (Breadth-First Search)

DFS (Depth-First Search)

Dijkstra’s Algorithm

A* Search Algorithm

Real-time visualization showing how each algorithm explores nodes and finds paths.

Grid-based maze environment where users can place walls, set start/end points, and watch algorithms in action.
